PyGyan.AI is an artificially intelligent chatbot that can respond to user 
questions based on the PyTorch documentation. The name PyGyan.AI 
is derived from two words: "Py" refers to Python (specifically Pytorch) 
and "Gyan" implies knowledge. 
PyGyan.AI is totally created from scratch with the Rasa framework, 
which is one of the best open source framework to build chatbots. The 
chatbot's user interface was created using the Flask web framework. 
The data required to train the bot was scraped from the official Pytorch 
documentation website using the scrapy framework, which is a popular 
open source framework for web scraping/crawling.
